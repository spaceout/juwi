*******Name Deviations********
Hate this name, wish i could use exceptions
Name deviations are when scene numbering and ttdb numbering dont match up
You can adjust:
 - season number
 - episode number
 - Show title

*******Data Sources********
TTDB:
http://thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Programmers_API
Date comes in two different formats:
  - XML for individual show or episode
  - Zip file containing all show and episode information
TTDB Time is seconds since the epoch
Search functionality is good

TVR:
http://services.tvrage.com/
Data comes in plain HTML more like plain text
No way to easily sync data to TTDB 100% due to fuzzy search logic

XBMC Database:
XBMC Database (external mysql database)
